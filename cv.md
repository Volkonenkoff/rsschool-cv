## About me

* My goal is to get the skills of front-end development from the beginning to the end. Find your favorite job with a good and pleasant team.
* I had an internship from the university in EPAM in the direction of Java development, now I want to try the other side :)
* If I’m really interested in something (and I’m interested in a lot of things), then I’m ready to devote a lot of time to this and I will learn faster than usual
